# YouTube TV
An app to run YouTube.com/tv on your computer

## Download
Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/CloudyDino/youtube-tv/releases), then download and run the latest installer.

## Background
I have an extra chromebook that I use to turn my TV into a "smart" TV. I realized that simply setting the user-agent to that of a Google TV allows me to open https://www.youtube.com/tv successfully so I can control it via my phone! I packaged this into an electron app so that evryone can run it on their personal computers that they may be using for their "smart" TVs.
